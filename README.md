# bunkerch (Formely sofich)
Somewhat of a 2ch-style textboard that I made nearly 2 years ago.

I shut my site down and never finished this. The default theme is now ugly and unfinished due to me changing it but not finishing when I almost used it again recently.

The mod interface was never truly implemented except for a primitive precursor to it that I abandoned, however the core functionality should be there for the regular users posting.
